# TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).
## Get the Data
The data is already provided for you.  You'll be using a subset of the original dataset.  It consists of only the scenes in Moe's Tavern.  This doesn't include other versions of the tavern, like "Moe's Cavern", "Flaming Moe's", "Uncle Moe's Family Feed-Bag", etc..

## Implement Preprocessing Functions
The first thing to do to any dataset is preprocessing.  Implement the following preprocessing functions below:
- Lookup Table
- Tokenize Punctuation

### Lookup Table
To create a word embedding, you first need to transform the words to ids.  In this function, create two dictionaries:
- Dictionary to go from the words to an id, we'll call `vocab_to_int`
- Dictionary to go from the id to word, we'll call `int_to_vocab`

Return these dictionaries in the following tuple `(vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)`


```python
import numpy as np
import problem_unittests as tests

def create_lookup_tables(text):
    """
    Create lookup tables for vocabulary
    :param text: The text of tv scripts split into words
    :return: A tuple of dicts (vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)
    """
    # TODO: Implement Function
    vocab_to_int = {w:i for i, w in enumerate(set(text))}
    int_to_vocab = {i:w for i, w in enumerate(set(text))}
    return vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab


"""

"""
tests.test_create_lookup_tables(create_lookup_tables)
```

    Tests Passed


### Tokenize Punctuation
We'll be splitting the script into a word array using spaces as delimiters.  However, punctuations like periods and exclamation marks make it hard for the neural network to distinguish between the word "bye" and "bye!".

Implement the function `token_lookup` to return a dict that will be used to tokenize symbols like "!" into "||Exclamation_Mark||".  Create a dictionary for the following symbols where the symbol is the key and value is the token:
- Period ( . )
- Comma ( , )
- Quotation Mark ( " )
- Semicolon ( ; )
- Exclamation mark ( ! )
- Question mark ( ? )
- Left Parentheses ( ( )
- Right Parentheses ( ) )
- Dash ( -- )
- Return ( \n )

This dictionary will be used to token the symbols and add the delimiter (space) around it.  This separates the symbols as it's own word, making it easier for the neural network to predict on the next word. Make sure you don't use a token that could be confused as a word. Instead of using the token "dash", try using something like "||dash||".


```python
def token_lookup():
    """
    Generate a dict to turn punctuation into a token.
    :return: Tokenize dictionary where the key is the punctuation and the value is the token
    """
    # TODO: Implement Function
    return {
        '.': '||Period||',
        ',': '||Comma||',
        '"': '||Quotation_Mark||',
        ';': '||Semicolon||',
        '!': '||Exclamation_mark||',
        '?': '||Question_mark||',
        '(': '||Left_Parentheses||',
        ')': '||Right_Parentheses||',
        '--': '||Dash||',
        "\n": '||Return||'
    }

### Input
Implement the `get_inputs()` function to create TF Placeholders for the Neural Network.  It should create the following placeholders:

### Batches
Implement `get_batches` to create batches of input and targets using `int_text`.  The batches should be a Numpy array with the shape `(number of batches, 2, batch size, sequence length)`. Each batch contains two elements:
- The first element is a single batch of **input** with the shape `[batch size, sequence length]`
- The second element is a single batch of **targets** with the shape `[batch size, sequence length]`

If you can't fill the last batch with enough data, drop the last batch.

For exmple, `get_batches([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 3, 2)` would return a Numpy array of the following:
```
[
  # First Batch
  [
    # Batch of Input
    [[ 1  2], [ 7  8], [13 14]]
    # Batch of targets
    [[ 2  3], [ 8  9], [14 15]]
  ]

  # Second Batch
  [
    # Batch of Input
    [[ 3  4], [ 9 10], [15 16]]
    # Batch of targets
    [[ 4  5], [10 11], [16 17]]
  ]

  # Third Batch
  [
    # Batch of Input
    [[ 5  6], [11 12], [17 18]]
    # Batch of targets
    [[ 6  7], [12 13], [18  1]]
  ]
]
```

Notice that the last target value in the last batch is the first input value of the first batch. In this case, `1`. This is a common technique used when creating sequence batches, although it is rather unintuitive.


```python
def get_batches(int_text, batch_size, seq_length):
    """
    Return batches of input and target
    :param int_text: Text with the words replaced by their ids

    target = np.array(int_text[1: n_batches * batch_size * seq_length + 1])

    data_batches = np.split(data.reshape(batch_size, -1), n_batches, 1)

    moe_szyslak: now, let's give ya... no, that's a smile.
    moe_szyslak:(quietly) no no, i'll take care of it.
    moe_szyslak: okay it's over! get 'em out of here!
    moe_szyslak:(sings) it's such a lovely blend...
    barney_gumble:(sings, in harmony) it's jolly / it's loyal / like i'm here!
    moe_szyslak: yeah, still not private enough.
    moe_szyslak: eh, what have i got to lose?

    bart_simpson: way to go, dad!
    homer_simpson: hey, i need someone to help me with the midnight beer delivery. your job is to distract barney until you guys


# The TV Script is Nonsensical
It's ok if the TV script doesn't make any sense.  We trained on less than a megabyte of text.  In order to get good results, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary or get more data.  Luckly there's more data!  As we mentioned in the begging of this project, this is a subset of [another dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data).  We didn't have you train on all the data, because that would take too long.  However, you are free to train your neural network on all the data.  After you complete the project, of course.
